We created the seed job for you, but you have to run it. When you do
run it, you have to provide some properties. By default we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global environment variables, you have to remove them from the
seed.

To run the demo, provide a comma-separated
list of the URLs of the two aforementioned forks (`github-webhook` and `github-analytics') in the `REPOS` variable.

The following images shows the steps involved:
