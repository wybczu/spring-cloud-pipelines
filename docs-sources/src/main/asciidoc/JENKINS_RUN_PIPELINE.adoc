We already created the seed job for you, but you have to run it. When you do
run it, you have to provide some properties. By default, we create a seed that
has all the properties options, but you can delete most of it. If you
set the properties as global environment variables, you have to remove them from the
seed.

To run the demo, provide a comma-separated
 list of URLs of the two aforementioned forks (`github-webhook` and `github-analytics`) in the `REPOS` variable.

The following images shows the steps involved:

IMPORTANT: If your build fails on *deploy previous version to stage* due to a missing jar,
that means that you forgot to clear the tags in your repository. Typically, that happens because
you removed the Artifactory volume with a deployed jar while a tag in the repository still points there.
See <<tags,here>> for how to remove the tag.

IMPORTANT: Servers often run run out of resources at the stage step.
For that reason, we suggest killing all applications on test. See the <<faq,FAQ>> for more detail.
