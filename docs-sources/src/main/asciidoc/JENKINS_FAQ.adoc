== Jenkins FAQ

This section provides answers to the most frequently asked questions about using Jenkins with Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Pipeline version contains ${PIPELINE_VERSION}::
You can check the Jenkins logs and see the following warning:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
WARNING: Skipped parameter `PIPELINE_VERSION` as it is undefined on `jenkins-pipeline-sample-build`.
	Set `-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters`=true to allow undefined parameters
	to be injected as environment variables or
	`-Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=[comma-separated list]`
	to whitelist specific parameter names, even though it represents a security breach
----
====
+
To fix it, you have to do exactly what the warning suggests. Also, you should ensure that the `Groovy token macro processing`
checkbox is set.

Pipeline version is not passed to the build::
You can see that the Jenkins version is properly set. However, in the build version, it is still snapshot and
the `echo "${PIPELINE_VERSION}"` does not print anything.
+
You can check the Jenkins logs and see the following warning:

The build times out with `pipeline.sh` information::
This is a Docker compose issue. The problem is that for some reason, only in Docker, the execution of
Java hangs. However, it hangs randomly and only the first time you try to run the pipeline.
+
The solution to this issue is to run the pipeline again. If it passes once,
it will pass for any subsequent build.
+
Another thing that you can try is to run it with plain Docker. That helps sometimes.

Can I use the pipeline for some other repositories?::
Yes. You can pass the `REPOS` variable with a comma-separated list of
`project_name$project_url` format. If you do not provide the `PROJECT_NAME`, the
repository name is extracted and used as the name of the project.
+
For example, a `REPOS` value equal to `https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook`
results in the creation of pipelines with root names `github-analytics` and `github-webhook`.
+
For example, a `REPOS` equal to `myanalytics$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics,myfeed$https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/atom-feed`
results in the creation of pipelines with root names `myanalytics` for `github-analytics`
and `myfeed` for `github-webhook`.

Can this work for ANY project out of the box?::
Not really. This is an "`opinionated pipeline`". That is why we took some
opinionated decisions, such as:
+
* Using Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner, and Spring Cloud Eureka.
* Application deployment to Cloud Foundry.
* Maven, including:
** Using the Maven Wrapper.
** Artifacts deployment by using `./mvnw clean deploy`.
** The `stubrunner.ids` property to retrieve the list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded.
** Running smoke tests on a deployed app with the `smoke` Maven profile.
** Running end to end tests on a deployed app with the `e2e` Maven profile.
* Gradle (in the `github-analytics` application check in the `gradle/pipeline.gradle` file), including:
** Using the Gradlew Wrapper.
** A `deploy` task for artifacts deployment.
** Running smoke tests on a deployed application with the `smoke` task.
** Running end to end tests on a deployed application with the `e2e` task.
** A `groupId` task to retrieve group ID.
** An `artifactId` task to retrieve artifact ID.
** A `currentVersion` task to retrieve the current version.
** A `stubIds` task to retrieve the list of collaborators for which stubs should be downloaded.
+
This is the initial approach that can be easily changed in the future.

Can I modify this to reuse in my project?::
Yes. It is open-source. The important thing is that the core part of the logic is written
in Bash scripts. That way, in the majority of cases, you could change only the bash
scripts without changing the whole pipeline.

The rollback step fails due to a missing JAR::
[[jenkins_tags]] You must have pushed some tags and have removed the Artifactory volume that
contained them. To fix this, remove the tags by using the following command:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
git tag -l | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
----
====

I want to provide a different JDK version.::
* By default, we assume that you have configured a JDK with an ID of `jdk8`.
* If you want a different one, override the `JDK_VERSION` environment variable to point to the proper one.
+
TIP: The docker image comes in with Java installed at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.
You can go to `Global Tools` and create a JDK with an ID of `jdk8` and set `JAVA_HOME`
to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.

To change the default settings, follow the steps shown in the following images:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/global_tool.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Global Tool'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/jdk_installation.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Click 'JDK Installations'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/jdk.png[caption="Step 4: ", title="Fill out JDK Installation with path to your JDK"]

[[groovy-token-macro]]
How can I enable groovy token macro processing?::
We scripted that. However, if you need to this manually, follow the steps shown in the following images:

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/manage_jenkins.png[caption="Step 1: ", title="Click 'Manage Jenkins'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/configure_system.png[caption="Step 2: ", title="Click 'Configure System'"]

image::{jenkins-root-docs}/groovy_token.png[caption="Step 3: ", title="Click 'Allow token macro processing'"]

How can I make deployment to stage and prod be automatic?::
Set the relevant property or environment variable to `true`:
+
* `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_STAGE` to automatically deploy to stage.
* `AUTO_DEPLOY_TO_PROD` to automatically deploy to prod.
+
How can I skip testing API compatibility?::
Set the `API_COMPATIBILITY_STEP_REQUIRED` environment variable
to `false` and re-run the seed (you can pick it from the seed
job's properties, too).

I can't tag the repo.::
You may get an error similar to the following:
+
====
[source,bash]
----

Most likely, you passed a wrong password. Check the <<jenkins_credentials,credentials>> section
for how to update your credentials.

I am unauthorized to deploy infrastructure jars.::
Most likely, you forgot to update your local `settings.xml` file with the Artifactory's
setup. Check out <<jenkins_settings,this section of the docs and update your `settings.xml` file>>.

Signing Artifacts::
In some cases, it may be required that, when you perform a release, that the artifacts be signed
before you push them to the repository.
To do this, you  need to import your GPG keys into the Docker image that runs Jenkins.
This can be done by placing a file called `public.key` that contains your public key
and a file called `private.key` that contains your private key in the `seed` directory.
These keys are imported by the `init.groovy` script runs when Jenkins starts.

Using SSH keys for Git::
The seed job checks whether an environment variable called `GIT_USE_SSH_KEY` is set to `true`. If it is `true`, the
environment variable called `GIT_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID` is chosen as the one that contains the
ID of the credential that contains SSH private key. By default, `GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID` is picked
as the one that contains the username and password to connect to git.
+
You can set these values in the seed job by filling out the form and toggling a checkbox.

Deploy to stage fails and does not redeploy a service (Kubernetes).::
There can be a number of reasons for this issue. Remember, though, that, for stage, we
assume that a sequence of manual steps needs to be performed. We do not
redeploy any existing services, because, most likely, you deliberately
have it set up that way. If, in the logs of your application,
you can see that you cannot connect to a service, first ensure that
the service is forwarding traffic to a pod. Next, if that is not the case,
delete the service and re-run the step in the pipeline. That way,
Spring Cloud Pipelines redeploy the service and the underlying pods.
